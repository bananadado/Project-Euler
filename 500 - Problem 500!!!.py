# Advent of Code 2022. the monkey one near the start where you do the modulus thing

# The 500500th prime is 7,376,507 according to https://t5k.org/nthprime/index.php#nth
# We know that the number is made up of primes, so we just construct it using primes ðŸ˜Ž #emojiCoding
# Every time it is multiplied by a prime, we can do the modulus thing just like that AoC problem as it doesn't matter in the end
# We are just trying to create a number using the smallest prime combo possible
